# Sherlocks - HackTheBox
In order to follow the Sherlock rules, I'll post my solutions once the Sherlock will be retired (therefore solvable only with a VIP subscription in some cases) by the HackTheBox team. The idea to post writeups came after I solved a bunch of Sherlocks, so for them I'll just post the official writeup by HackTheBox (if it is available) (I don't have a VIP subscription to HackTheBox) and not my messy notes. For the future Sherlocks I'll solve, I'll post my own writeups.
