# My CTFs/Labs writeups
In my free time I enjoy doing CTFs and solving Labs. I decided to save in one place all my solutions.
- [Sherlocks Hack the Box](./sherlocks-hackthebox/README.md)
- [Reverse Engineering Challenges HackTheBox](./reverse-engineering-hackthebox/README.md)
- [DFIR Report Labs](https://thedfirreport.com/services/dfir-labs/) (Solutions not available, TLP:RED)
    - [BlueSky lab](https://the-dfir-report-store.myshopify.com/products/case-19208)
